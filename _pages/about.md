Hi! I am a senior B.Sc. Student at the University of Tehran, and I have the pleasure of working with [Mohammad Taher Pilehvar](https://pilehvar.github.io/){:target="_blank"}, [Yadollah Yaghoobzadeh](https://yyaghoobzadeh.github.io/){:target="_blank"}, and [Azadeh Shakery](https://ece.ut.ac.ir/en/~shakery){:target="_blank"} on natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning.

My primary research interest lies in the area of natural language processing (NLP), where I have an EMNLP2021 (BlackboxNLP) paper about layer-wise probing pre-trained language models. My B.Sc. final project was about assessing toxic detection knowledge of foundation models where I showed their interesting ability gained in pre-training as well as their possible biases towards specific persons or groups.

Here is my [Curriculum Vitae]().
